        <h2>Getting all set up</h2>
        <h3><a id="vsCode">Visual Studio Code</a></h3>
        <p>There are many technologies and integrated development environments available to designers and developers. If
            you look at current job descriptions referencing front-end web design and development, you will find that
            qualification statements center on core technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript versus specific
            development software tools. Sometimes preferred development technologies are listed, and they are specific
            to that organization. The debate about the best tool to use is ongoing and opinionated. The intent of this
            class is not to teach a tool but rather provide a firm foundation in core web technologies.</p>
        <p>Visual Studio (VS) Code is one of many markup editors that can be used for front-end web design and
            development. This course uses VS Code as the recommended editor because it is free, popular in the industry
            (as shown by <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#development-environments-and-tools"
                target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>), and easy to use. In addition, VS Code works on the common system
            platforms of Windows, macOS, and Linux. It will behave basically the same on all of these operating systems
            and has a very active development cycle and online support system which means it is being updated regularly
            and new tools are developed regularly. This course will will use the VS Code editor to write HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. In addition, VS Code has git technology and services built into the editor. This allows you to
            practice source control and publish your local content to a remote GitHub Pages repository for user
            consumption on a public domain name.</p>
        <h4>Download and Install Instructions</h4>
        <img src="images/read1.png" alt="vs code installation" class="img-tutorial">
        <p>Install the Visual Studio Code programming environment on your local system and become familiar with some
            basic operations, tooling, and features.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate to the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code installation page.</a>

                <p>Download the stable build for your platform OS.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Note that by downloading and using VS Code, you agree to the <a
                        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/license">license terms</a> and <a
                        href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=528096&amp;clcid=0x409">privacy statement</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Locate the download and start the installation for your platform as guided by the installation
                    routine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Proceed through all the steps as given until VS Code is installed and verify that you can start VS
                    Code.</p>

            to download and install Microsoft Teams on

            collaboration. For this purpose, you're also encouraged to install it on your mobile device. Once you have
            installed it, log in with your byui email and credentials. You will then see our WDD230 team that you've
            been invited to. </p>
        <p>Before you get started in Teams, please take a moment to read about <a

        <h3 id="github">Github</h3>
        <p>GitHub is a free collaboration and version control online service. You can think of the GitHub repositories
            as a cloud-based storage system for your projects. GitHub can be used as an web hosting service with a
            special repository named GitHub Pages. We will use GitHub Pages to publish assignments in this course.
            GitHub is based upon Gitâ€”a version control framework (software).</p>
        <p>Think of repositories as folders. They are special folders in that they are linked and supported by
            collaborative and file history information, all of which is hidden in the background. You will be working
            with a local repository, i.e., a folder on your computer system, that is linked to a remote repository on
            GitHub. You will work locally and then when you are ready to publish to the web, you will upload or push the
            content to the remote, duplicate repository.</p>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>If you have a Github account, you do not need to do this.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Navigate in your browser to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a username, enter your BYU-Idaho email address, and create a password to obtain an account and
                    click the button 'Sign Up for GitHub'.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Record your username and password in a secure and logical location.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Choose the public option in the next screen and continue to the next step.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the final screen of the setup, select your preferences to create your account.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify your account through the email that is sent to your BYU-Idaho email address.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Verify that your GitHub account is active by navigating in your browser to
                    https://github.com/yourusername. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="newRepo">Create a new Repo and set up Github Pages</h3>
        <p>"GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages
            directly from a GitHub repository" &mdash;<a

                Pages?</a></p>
        <p>In this course, you will be publishing your weekly web work to your GitHub Pages hosted site. The instructor
            will then be able to access your site and conduct feedback and assessment as needed. This whole process of
            file management, working with repositories, and version control is also a skill set that is required in
            front-end web design and development. You have already established a GitHub account, and you will now make a
            special, GitHub Pages repository which will host your web work.</p>
        <p>You will need to name your repository <strong>exactly</strong> as demonstrated.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to your <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a> account.</li>
            <li>Create a new private repository by either clicking the plus symbol at the upper-right portion of the
                screen and selecting <strong>New repository</strong> or clicking the <strong>New repository</strong>
                green button if you are on the GitHub generic home page.</li>
            <li>On the new repository screen, enter the new <strong>repository name</strong> using your owner/username
                followed by ".github.io". For example, if my username was "orsonpratt", my repository name should be
                entered as "orsonpratt.github.io" in the text box provided.
                <br />
                <span>Do not leave off the username as many students think it is already provided. It is NOT already
                    provided, rather the username shown before the textbox is indicating in what folder or user this
                    repository is being created, thus the front slash. Note this example:

        <h1>Assignment #1</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Today, you will complete your first assignment for this course. You will have an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts taught in this module, and surely you will learn a lot as you develop a program of your own. These assignments are designed to be both fun and educational, as well as give you an opportunity to stretch yourself and develop your skills.</p>
        <p>Your tasks are as follows:</p>
        <h3>Create the file and run it in the browser:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new html file in your text editor</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use the <code>!</code> shortcut shown in the reading material to generate an html template for you to use.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add a <code>script</code> tag to the <code><head></code> of the head of your html document. This will look very similar to the <a href="class1.html" target="_blank">hello world</a> activity done previously. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a js file and add the filename to the <code>script</code> tag listed above.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save the file, and run it in the browser. Ensure that you can make it this far.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Create a friendly JavaScript program</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Prompt the user for their name. In the class activity, you used the <code>alert</code> function to show a popup in the browser. Now, you will use the <code>prompt()</code> function. The <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_prompt.asp" target="_blank"> w3schools page</a> on prompt() may be helpful as you do this.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Save the user's name in a variable called <code>username</code></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Using <code>alert()</code>, send a message to this user that includes both their name and something that you have found to be meaningful in your life. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>If you had fun working on this assignment and want to do more, here are some suggestions...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Have multiple <code>prompt()</code>s and save multiple variables. Change your message to include all of them. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You learned how to do arithmetic in the reading this week, try to add some math into your program. You may want to look into <code><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp" target="_blank">parseFloat()</a></code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use an if statement based on user input. Perhaps you prompt them asking if they want two messages or one. Change your output based on the if statement from their choice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add something to your html file.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
